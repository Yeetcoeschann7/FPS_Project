 This is an FPS game I'm making in my free time to teach myself 3D game development.
 I appreciate any comments or criticism anyone may have, and I hope you find my game fun!

 CONTROLS:
 - 'WASD' Movement
 - 'Left click' to shoot
 - 'R' to reload
 - Pause with 'esc'
 - Navigate menus with 'arrow keys' and 'Enter'
